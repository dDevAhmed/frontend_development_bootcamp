## Bakery Project

This document provides an overview of the Bakery Project, a bakery management system I built while attending a frontend development bootcamp.

**Project Overview:**

This project simulates a bakery management system, allowing users to navigate through various functionalities essential for bakery operations.

**Features:**

* **Mobile-Friendly Navigation:** The navigation adapts seamlessly for a smooth user experience on mobile devices.
* **Navigation Links:**
    * Home
    * About Us
    * Contact Us
    * Forms (dropdown)
        * Add Customer
        * Add Product
        * Add Category
        * Place Order
        * Add Supplier
        * Add Sale
        * Add Employee
        * Update Inventory

**Functionality (Planned Enhancements):**

This initial version focuses on the user interface and navigation. Future development will implement:

* Logic to handle form submissions for adding and updating data (customers, products, orders, etc.).
* Integration with a database for persistent storage and retrieval of bakery data.

**Live Preview:**

* Check out a live preview of the Bakery Project here: [Bakery App](https://ddevahmed.github.io/frontend_development_bootcamp/).

**Additional Notes:**

This project serves as a foundation for building a comprehensive bakery management system. It showcases my frontend development skills gained during the bootcamp, particularly in creating responsive user interfaces and navigation structures.

Feel free to explore the codebase and consider potential future contributions!
